// Package wardleyToGo provides primitives to build an in-memory map (a plan).
//
// In the context of the package "a map" represents a landscape.
//
// The landscape is made of "Components". Each component knows its own location on a map.
//
// Components can collaborate, meaning that they may be linked together. Therefore a map is also
// a graph.
//
// The entrypoint of this API is the 'Map' structure
